# VNLA with Object Co-occurrence directory

This directory contains files for VNLA modified with object co-occurrence information in the form of a conditional occurrence matrix (COM). To run it, replace the original VNLA folder under `root_dir/code/tasks/` with this folder, and change its name from `VNLA_OC` to `VNLA`.

`object_detection_model.py`: newly added module to integrate COM into the original VNLA network

`matrix.pt`: a PyTorch pickle file to save the COM. It's used by the agent's model. It can be generated by the scripts in the `vnla/object_cooccurrence/` folder in this repo.
